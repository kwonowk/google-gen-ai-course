    "## Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph applications are built around a **graph** structure. As the developer, you define an application graph that models the state transitions for your application. Your app will define a **state** schema, and an instance of that schema is propagated through the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **node** in the graph represents an action or step that can be taken. Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you define. These changes can be the result of invoking an LLM, by calling an API, or executing any logic that the node defines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **edge** in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a text-only chatbot where output is always displayed to a user, you may always transition from `chatbot -> user`. The transitions can also be conditional, allowing you to add branching (like an `if-else` statement) or looping (like `for` or `while` loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is highly extensible and provides a number of features that are not part of this tutorial, such as memory, persistance and streaming. To better understand the key concepts and philophies behind LangGraph, check out their [Conceptual guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/) and [High-level overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/)."

    "State is a fundamental concept for a LangGraph app. A state object is passed between every node and transition in the app. Here you define a state object, `OrderState`, that holds the conversation history, a structured order, and a flag indicating if the customer has finished placing their order. For simplicity, the \"structure\" in this order is just a list of strings, but this can be expanded to any Python data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the LangGraph state object is a Python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict). You can provide a schema for this dictionary by defining it as a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict).\n",
